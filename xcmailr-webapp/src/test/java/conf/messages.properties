app_Welcome=Welcome to XCMailr - Your place for temporary email addresses
app_Description=XCMailr helps you to reduce the amount of spam in your email account. Create temporary email addresses, set a lifetime if needed, and XCMailr will forward all incoming email to your real email account. XCMailr does not store any email content, it does not notify the sender if the email address is not longer valid or inactive, and all incoming email that does not have any matching forward email, will be silently dropped.
